<h1>Zip Code Radius Search</h1>
<p>	Zip code radial searching requires you to convert zip code to geo coordinates, do the maths based on miles selected, while doing a query to pull the other zip codes</p>
	
<p>This assumes you have a zipcode & geo location MySQL table (see zipcodes.sql). This is using the CodeIgniter DB class. If unfamiliar with CodeIgniter DB class, it's pretty self explanatory.</p>
